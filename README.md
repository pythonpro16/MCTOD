Dataset Name: Multi-Cloud Task Optimization Dataset (MCTOD)

Dataset Description:
The Multi-Cloud Task Optimization Dataset (MCTOD) is a synthetic dataset generated for research purposes in the domain of multi-cloud task optimization. It consists of simulated data representing various aspects of the problem, including cloud providers, virtual machine (VM) families, task sets, resource constraints, and performance metrics. The dataset is designed to facilitate experimentation and analysis in the field of cloud computing, specifically focusing on the selection of appropriate clouds and VMs to execute bags-of-tasks (BoT) efficiently across multiple cloud platforms. Each entry in the dataset includes information about the task set ID, the number of tasks in the set, the resource constraint factor, and performance metrics such as makespan reduction, resource utilization, cost, and scalability. Researchers can use this dataset to develop and evaluate algorithms for optimizing BoT execution in multi-cloud environments, explore trade-offs between performance metrics, and analyze the impact of varying resource constraints on task execution efficiency.s
